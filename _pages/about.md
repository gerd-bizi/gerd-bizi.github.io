I'm a senior undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, studying [Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu) (with a *Focus in AI*) and [Biochemistry](https://biochemistry.utoronto.ca). I've taken advanced coursework in structural biology, medical biochemistry, deep learning, computer vision, statistical learning, bioinformatics, and more.

My current research interests are in 3D reconstruction, specifically in the context of the **cryo-EM problem**. My senior thesis aims to develop methodology to reconstruct membrane proteins embedded in their native lipid bilayer by using prior knowledge about their relative orientation. I'm co-supervised by [Dr. John L. Rubinstein](https://www.rubinsteinlab.org) at SickKids and [Dr. David J. Fleet](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fleet/) at Vector Institute. I'm mentored by [Shayan Shekarforoush](https://shekshaa.github.io), a PhD student at Vector Institute, and [Ryan Karimi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ekl4WVEAAAAJ&hl=en), an MD/PhD student at UofT.

This is a reconstruction of V-ATPase found in a synaptic vesicle.

I've also been trained as a wet-lab scientist, and have experience in confocal fluorescence microscopy, tissue culture, and protein purification, done under the supervision of [Dr. Peter K. Kim](https://biochemistry.utoronto.ca/person/peter-k-kim/) at SickKids. In Dr. Kim's lab, I completed a summer research project and my junior thesis, where I looked at looked at translocation patterns of mitochondrial and peroxisomal proteins; and studied the fission machinery of mitochondria.

I'm more broadly interested in computational imaging, bioinformatics, and computational neuroscience, and will be pursuing post-graduate studies in (more than one?) these fields.

My hobbies include playing basketball, trying coffee shops around Toronto, and playing the official format of the Pok√©mon videogame, [VGC](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com).
