I'm a Master's student in the Department of [Medical Biophysics](https://medbio.utoronto.ca) at the University of Toronto where <u>I am currently completing rotations.</u> I completed my undergraduate degree at U of T, where I studied [Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu) (with a [Focus in AI](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/program/asfoc1689b)) and [Biochemistry](https://biochemistry.utoronto.ca). I've taken advanced coursework in deep learning, computer vision, statistical learning, structural biology, bioinformatics, computational biology, and more.

This past summer, I was an RA at the [Sunnybrook Research Institute](https://research.sunnybrook.ca/) and I worked on two projects. The first was developing a multi-omic model for predicting breast cancer subtypes and the second is predicting recurrence of bladder cancer using WSIs. I was grateful to be supervised by Dr. Martin Yaffe and Dr. Alison Cheung at the [Biomarker Imaging Research Laboratory](https://research.sunnybrook.ca/facilities-and-research-groups/biomarker-imaging-research-laboratory/) and [Dr. Anne Martel](https://research.sunnybrook.ca/researchers/anne-martel/).

A large research interest of mine during my undergraduate degree was the **cryo-em problem**. My senior thesis aimed to develop methodology to reconstruct membrane proteins embedded in their native lipid bilayer by using prior knowledge about their relative orientation. I was co-supervised by [Dr. John L. Rubinstein](https://www.rubinsteinlab.org) at SickKids and [Dr. David J. Fleet](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fleet/) at Vector Institute.

I was trained as a wet-lab scientist with experience in confocal fluorescence microscopy, tissue culture, and protein purification under [Dr. Peter K. Kim](https://biochemistry.utoronto.ca/faculty/peter-kim) at SickKids, where I completed a summer project and junior thesis on mitochondrial and peroxisomal protein translocation and mitochondrial fission.

I'm more broadly interested in computational imaging, bioinformatics, and computational neuroscience, among other fields.

My hobbies include reading, playing [basketball](https://www.gerdbizi.com/basketball), trying coffee shops around Toronto, and playing the official format of the Pok√©mon videogame, [VGC](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com).
